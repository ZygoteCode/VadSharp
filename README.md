## 🚀 The Best VAD Implementation in C#

VadSharp is the **first and most efficient** implementation of **[Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/) in C#**, supporting the latest **V5 model** with all its advanced features. It is faster than the original Python version and runs on **any GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) and CPU** with **ONNXRuntime and DirectML**.

This project represents **my first significant contribution to the world of artificial intelligence in terms of development**, and I sincerely hope that users will appreciate this effort. Your support and feedback are highly valued! 🙌

## 🛠 Features & Benefits

✅ **Stellar Accuracy** - Excellent results in speech detection tasks.

⚡ **Fast** - Processes 30ms+ audio chunks in under **1ms** on a single CPU thread, even faster with batching or GPU acceleration.

📦 **Lightweight** - Model size is only **~2MB**.

🌎 **General** - Trained on **6,000+ languages**, handling various background noises and recording conditions.

🎚 **Flexible Sampling Rate** - Supports **8000 Hz and 16000 Hz**.

🌍 **Highly Portable** - Runs anywhere **ONNX and ML.NET** are available.

🔓 **No Strings Attached** - **MIT License**, no telemetry, no registration, no vendor lock-in.

## 🧑‍💻 Example Usage

```csharp
using System.Text;
using VadSharp;

public class Program
{
    private const int SAMPLE_RATE = 16000;
    private const float THRESHOLD = 0.5f;
    private const int MIN_SPEECH_DURATION_MS = 250;
    private const float MAX_SPEECH_DURATION_SECONDS = float.PositiveInfinity;
    private const int MIN_SILENCE_DURATION_MS = 100;
    private const int SPEECH_PAD_MS = 30;

    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.Title = "VadSharpExample | Made by https://github.com/GabryB03/";

        string modelPath = Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "resources", "silero_vad.onnx");
        string audioPath = Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "resources", "test.wav");

        if (!File.Exists(modelPath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Model file not found: {modelPath}");
            return;
        }

        if (!File.Exists(audioPath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Audio file not found: {audioPath}");
            return;
        }

        VadDetector vadDetector = new VadDetector(modelPath, THRESHOLD, SAMPLE_RATE, MIN_SPEECH_DURATION_MS, MAX_SPEECH_DURATION_SECONDS, MIN_SILENCE_DURATION_MS, SPEECH_PAD_MS);
        List<VadSpeechSegment> speechTimeList = vadDetector.GetSpeechSegmentList(audioPath);
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        foreach (VadSpeechSegment speechSegment in speechTimeList)
        {
            sb.AppendLine($"[-] Start second: {speechSegment.StartSecond.ToString().Replace(",", ".")}s, end second: {speechSegment.EndSecond.ToString().Replace(",", ".")}s");
        }

        Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```
